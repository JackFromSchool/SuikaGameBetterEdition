# Suika Game New Years Edition!

A fun clone of the hit Suika Game. Made for a high school CS class!

## Gameplay

There is no way to win, rather you can try to rack up a high score. To build up your score, drop fruits and get them to combine in order to gain increasing amounts of points. Be carefull to not let the fruits reach the cloud, otherwise you'll lose. 

## Controls

* <kbd>A</kbd> to move left and <kbd>D</kbd> to move right
* <kbd>W</kbd> or <kbd>S</kbd> to drop the held fruit

## Info

Everything for this project was done in the base Godot engine. Every script was written in gdScript and was written completely by us.

While working on this project we used Godot v4.2.1 stable. It is unlikely that we will ever revist it to port it to a later version. If you do want to play it for yourself, use that version or try a later version at your own risk.
